def: zlibVersion
stack: -- zstr
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Returns a zstring containing the version of the ZLIB library loaded.
=

def: zlib_uncompress
stack: dest destsize^ src srcsize -- result
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Decompresses the source buffer into the destination buffer. sourceLen is the
	byte length of the source buffer. Upon entry, destLen is the total size of
	the destination buffer, which must be large enough to hold the entire
	uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data must have been saved
	previously by the compressor and transmitted to the decompressor by some
	mechanism outside the scope of this compression library.) Upon exit, destLen
	is the actual size of the compressed buffer.

	This function can be used to decompress a whole file at once if the input
	file is mmap'ed.

	uncompress returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
	memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output buffer, or
	Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted. 
=

def: zlib_compress
stack: dest destsize^ src srcsize -- result
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Compresses the source buffer into the destination buffer. sourceLen is the
	byte length of the source buffer. Upon entry, destLen is the total size of
	the destination buffer, which must be at least 0.1% larger than sourceLen
	plus 12 bytes. Upon exit, destLen is the actual size of the compressed
	buffer.

	This function can be used to compress a whole file at once if the input file
	is mmap'ed.

	compress returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
	memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output buffer.
=

def: zlib_compressBound
stack: len -- maxlen
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Returns the maximum size required to compress "len" bytes.
=

def: zlib_crc32
stack: crc buf len -- crc'
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Update a running crc with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and return the updated
	crc. If buf is NULL, this function returns the required initial value for
	the crc. Pre- and post-conditioning (one's complement) is performed within
	this function so it shouldn't be done by the application. Usage example:

		0 value crc
		0 0 0 zlib_crc32 to crc 
		repeat
			num-bytes read-buffer if
				crc buffer num-bytes zlib_crc32 to crc
			then
		while
		...
=

def: gzclose
stack: handle -- result
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file and
	deallocates all the (de)compression state. The return value is the zlib
	error number (see function gzerror below).
=

def: gztell
stack: handle -- offset
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Returns the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
	compressed file. This position represents a number of bytes in the
	uncompressed data stream.

	gztell(file) is equivalent to gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_CUR) 
=

def: gzseek
stack: handle offset whence -- offset
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Sets the starting position for the next gzread or gzwrite on the given
	compressed file. The offset represents a number of bytes in the uncompressed
	data stream. The whence parameter is defined as in lseek(2); the value
	SEEK_END is not supported.

	If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
	extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
	supported ; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
	starting position.

	gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from the
	beginning of the uncompressed stream, or -1 in case of error, in particular
	if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position would be
	before the current position. 
=

def: gzwrite
stack: handle buf len -- written
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Writes the given number of uncompressed bytes into the compressed file.
	gzwrite returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually written (0 in case
	of error).
=

def: gzread
stack: handle buf len -- read
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file. If
	the input file was not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number of
	bytes into the buffer.

	gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read (0 for end of
	file, -1 for error). 
=

def: gzopen
stack: zpath mode -- handle
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing. The mode parameter is as in
	fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or a
	strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman only
	compression as in "wb1h". (See the description of deflateInit2 for more
	information about the strategy parameter.)

	gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format ; in this case
	gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.

	gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened or if there was
	insufficient memory to allocate the (de)compression state 
=

def: util/zlib 
ctx: ~
desc: +
	Simple wrapper around the ZLIB compression library.  See the ZLIB
	documentation for detailed information on these words.
